(* File Operations
1. Reading from file. (Variables)
2. Reading mutiple lines and log using repeatindex.
3. Reading text from CSV
*)


(*******************************
1. Accessing the basic file, Data deriven testing.
********************************)

//Reading from note pad
put file ResourcePath("Test1.txt") into var
log var


//reading from excel.
put file ResourcePath("Test2.xlsx") into var
log var

//reading from excel with 2003 versio.
put file ResourcePath("Test3.xls") into var1


//reading the text from MS Word having text, tables and images.
put file ResourcePath("Sample text and table.docx") into var2

(******************************************
2. Reading the file with multiple lines of text and printing using repeatindex.
*******************************************)


put file ResourcePath("Test1.txt") into var
put the number of lines  of var into count
log count
//log line 3 of var
//using Put for repeat index.
repeat count times
	put line repeatindex() of var into rr
	log rr
end repeat

//using insert for repeat index.
typetext enterKey
log "Loop using the index with repeatindex "
typetext enterKey
repeat count times
	put line repeatindex() of var into rr
	log rr
	put "" into rr
end repeat


(**************************
3. Reading text from CSV file

Note:
--------------------------------------
All columns are called as Items 
All Rows are called as Lines

Syntax while accessing is 
item <column number> of line <row number> of <list>
-----------------------------------------------------------
4. Writing to the file.

******************************)


//Reading the file and logging one value

put file ResourcePath("Data.csv") into data_list
//log data_list
log item 3 of line 1 of data_list


//Reading the file and logging whole column


put file ResourcePath("Data.csv") into data_list
put (the number of lines of data_list)-1 into LineCount
put the number of items of line 1 of data_list into ColumnCount
log "Row Count:" , LineCount
log "Column Count:", ColumnCount
put 0 into flag
Repeat LineCount times
	put line (repeatIndex()+1) of data_list into patientinfo
	Repeat ColumnCount times
		put item repeatIndex() of patientinfo into value
		//log value
		if repeatindex() equal 6
			if value contains "DOC-VR-CN-Text Formatting"
				LogSuccess "Item Foud"
				put 1 into flag
				exit repeat
			end if
		end if
	End repeat
	if flag equal 1
		Exit repeat
	end if
End repeat

//Not working -- need to find a way to use repeatindex more efficiently.

put file ResourcePath("Data.csv") into data_list
put (the number of lines of data_list)-1 into LineCount
put the number of items of line 1 of data_list into ColumnCount
log "Row Count:" , LineCount
log "Column Count:", ColumnCount
Repeat LineCount times
	put line (repeatIndex()+1) of data_list into patientinfo
	Repeat ColumnCount times
		put item repeatIndex() of patientinfo into value
		log repeatIndex()
	end repeat
End repeat



(*  Try catch *)

try
	log "try block statments"
	
catch exception
	
	log " exception"
	
end try


//Write text to the notepad file.

put file ResourcePath("Test1.txt") into TxtFile

Log "**Text before updating**"
log TxtFile

put ResourcePath("Test1.txt") into TxtFile

open file TxtFile for readWrite
put "New line text5" into NewValue
write return to file TxtFile at eof
write NewValue to file TxtFile

close file TxtFile

put file ResourcePath("Test1.txt") into TxtFile
Log "**Text After updating**"
log TxtFile
